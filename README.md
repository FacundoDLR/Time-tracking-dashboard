# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](https://time-tracking-dashboard-omega-gilt.vercel.app//design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".
